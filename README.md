# GitErDone

This is the readme file for my first personal repository.

## Second level titles can be formatted using "##" at the start of the line.

*italics* can be written with asterisks at the start and end of the text.

**bold** can be written with double asterisks at the start and end of the text.

1. List
2. Are
3. Easy
4. Too

I branched another version off the master, and am now updating the master.
